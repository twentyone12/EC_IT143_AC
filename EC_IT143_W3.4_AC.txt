-- Q1: Q1 - Business User question - Moderate complexity: Can you provide a list of customers who purchased in March 2014 and the total amount they spent?(Rolando Ismael Alfaro Ramirez)
-- A1: This is going to sum the TotalDue column and rename it to TotalSpent but only where the dates are between March 1 and 31

SELECT CustomerID, SUM(TotalDue) AS TotalSpent
FROM Sales.SalesOrderHeader
WHERE OrderDate BETWEEN '2014-03-01' AND '2014-03-31'
GROUP BY CustomerID;

---Q4Business User question - Marginal complexity: What is the total number of bicycles in inventory? (Samuel Owusu Boampong)
-- This is going to sume the quantity column but only where the productnumber starts with BK, I found out those are the only complete bikes
SELECT SUM(Quantity) AS TotalBikes

);
---Q5: Business User question - Increased complexity: Get the average age of employees from the BusinessEntity table. What is the average cost of each order? (Sambo Dari)
---The business entity table doesn't have an age column so I modified this a bit to be my own question of average order cost. It just averages the total due from the SalesOrderHeader table
SELECT
    AVG(TotalDue) AS AverageOrderCost
FROM
    Sales.SalesOrderHeader;
---Q6 - Business User question - Increased complexity: Sales territories will undergo relocation of salespeople, to help with logistics we need to know which areas have the lowest number of salespeople. Which territories have the lowest number of sellers? (Alexandre Cerqueira Da Silva Filho)

---Sales Persons renamed as SellersCount. Join the SalesPerson table on the TerritoryID and ordeer A-Z
SELECT
    SalesTerritory.TerritoryID,
    SalesTerritory.Name,
    COUNT(SalesPerson.BusinessEntityID) AS SellersCount
FROM
    Sales.SalesTerritory
LEFT JOIN

GROUP BY

ORDER BY
    SellersCount ASC;

SELECT CustomerID, 
FirstName as Customer Name
Email, 
Person.Password.Password
FROM Person.Person
ORDER BY "Customer Name" ASC;
---Q8 - Business User question - Marginal complexity: Count the distinct colors for mountain bikes? (Samuel Owusu Boampong)
